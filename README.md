JavaScript and DOM manipulation were used to create the gameâ€™s grid. 

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < squareCount; i++){
      const square = document.createElement('div')
      square.classList.add('square')
      // square.innerText = i
      grid.appendChild(square)
      squares.push(square)
    }
```
